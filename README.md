This is a small test program I wrote in C++, to get a grip on the language (as well as SDL).
The name is completely arbitrary; I picked it simply because it's a comically normal name (as opposed to other projects with fancy, techy names).

# Compiling
This should be able to compile in Visual Studio just fine.  No clue how to compile this with GCC, unfortunately (I'm sure it isn't too hard though!).
